The PAWS API uses API keys along with Username and Password to allow access to the API.  The Username and Password are associated to your core Client account with Kroll and each API Key is registered to that account, this allows multiple developers or teams access to the PAWS API with a unique identifier.

You can register for an API Key or PAWS API account at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

PAWS expects for the API Key, Username, and Password to be included in all API requests to the server in the JSON body data.
