# Getting Started

Welcome to the PAWS API online documentation.  

The PAWS API is a set of RESTful API endpoints hosted by Kroll to support developers in interacting with Kroll's systems and services.

To get started using the PAWS API, you'll need to sign up for a developer account at our [developer portal](http://www.google.com).  Once your account is created you'll have your `userName`, `password`, and `apiKey` needed to start working with the different API's available.
